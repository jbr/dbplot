h1. DBPlot

DBPlot is some ruby glue between MySQL and R.  It generates and runs R based on a SQL-like DSL.  It is still very early in development.  The goal is to make it simpler to get common plots out of a database.  For more complex examples, there will be an export mode, which will let you save the output R source file for further editing.

h2. Example

@ruby dbplot.rb "plot yvar vs xvar from tablename into my.pdf"@

This would generate and execute a MySQL query (@select yvar, xvar from tablename@), pass it to R, and use ggplot2 to generate the appropriate plot (@qplot(xvar, yvar, data=data.from.mysql)@) and save it to a pdf.  The eventual plan is to support as much of common interactions between a database and ggplot2, including joins, faceting, grouping, coloring, summarization, different geoms, etc.
