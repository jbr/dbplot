h1. DBPlot

DBPlot is some ruby glue between MySQL and R.  It generates and runs R based on a SQL-like DSL.  It is still very early in development.  The goal is to make it simpler to get common plots out of a database.  For more complex examples, there will be an export mode, which will let you save the output R source file for further editing.

h2. Installation

<pre><code>sudo gem install dbplot</code></pre>

h2. Example

<pre><code>dbplot -d database -u username -p password -q "plot yvar vs xvar from tablename"</code></pre>

This would generate and execute a MySQL query (@select yvar, xvar from tablename@), pass it to R, and use ggplot2 to generate the appropriate plot (@qplot(xvar, yvar, data=data.from.mysql)@) and save it to a pdf (by default, out.pdf).

h2. Syntax

<pre><code>
PLOT y_variable [AS y_variable_alias] VS x_variable [AS x_variable_alias] FROM table_name
  [COLOR BY color_variable [AS color_variable_alias]]
  [INTO output_filename.pdf]


h2. Project Goals:

Support as much of common interactions between a database and ggplot2, including joins, faceting, grouping, coloring, summarization, different geoms, etc.

Lock down the security so this can be run in a sandbox through a web interface; users could type in queries and get plots back against a database.
